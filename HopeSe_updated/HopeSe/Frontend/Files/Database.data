HopeSe : Ludo is a classic board game. Would you like to play a text-based version of Ludo?
Muskan Mishra : Yes.
HopeSe : Let's start a new game of Ludo. You will play as "X" and I will play as "O". The goal is to move all of your pieces around the board and reach the final destination before I do.
Here is the starting board:
```
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   | X | X | X | X |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  | O | O | O | O |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```
You can roll a dice to determine how many spaces to move your piece. The number on the dice will tell you how many spaces to move.
Rolling the dice... You got a 4. Which piece would you like to move? (1, 2, 3, or 4)
Muskan Mishra : Sorry what do you say i didn't listen can you again repeat it?
HopeSe : Let's start a new game of Ludo. You will play as "X" and I will play as "O". The goal is to move all of your pieces around the board and reach the final destination before I do.

  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  | O | O | O | O |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```
You can roll a dice to determine how many spaces to move your piece. The number on the dice will tell you how many spaces to move.
Rolling the dice... You got a 4. Which piece would you like to move? (1, 2, 3, or 4)
Muskan Mishra : Three.
HopeSe : You've decided to move piece 3. Since you rolled a 4, you can move piece 3 four spaces.
Here's the updated board:
```
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   | X | X |   | X |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   | X |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  | O | O | O | O |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```
Now it's my turn. I'll roll the dice... I got a 3. I'll move one of my pieces three spaces.
Here's the updated board:
```
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   | X | X |   | X |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   | X |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  | O | O | O |   | O |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
  |   |   |   |   |   |
  +---+---+---+---+---+
```
It's your turn again. Roll the dice by typing "roll".
